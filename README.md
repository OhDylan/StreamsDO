# StreamsDO

This is a simple live streaming website (something like Twitch but a much much simplified version).

It has a very clean cut interface, by using semantic UI for basic styling. This project was just for the purpose of getting more familiar with React / Redux application.

Users are able to connect their OBS software with this website and create their own live streams. At the moment only Google OAuth is available for authentication, you may add others!
